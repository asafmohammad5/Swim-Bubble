# Swim-Bubble

An interactive game where the player must get air bubbles in order to keep themselves from drowning!


## How to play

The player gets 3 lives when the game starts. He/She must click on the screen in order to move up and avoid clicking to move down. The player will want to move up or down in order to get air bubbles that are coming their way. If they miss more then 2 air bubbles, this will result in a loss and they will have to start over.
