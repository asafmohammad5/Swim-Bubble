      <p>Swim Bubble was inspired by the well known game Flappy Bird, which was created
        by Dong Nguyen in 2013. 
      </p>
      <p>Swim Bubble was created by Asaf Mohammad. The source code for this game can be found at
        <a class="github" href="https://github.com/asafmohammad5/Swim-Bubble">Github</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>The player needs to get the big air bubbles in order to stay alive. By
        left clicking with the mouse the dolphin will move up, and not clicking at all the dolphin will
        begin to move down. Avoid the red coral at the bottom, dont swim to far up, and dont run out of breath!</p>
